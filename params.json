With this context, these algorithms are assessed in one\r\nof two ways, viz. theoretical, and empirical analysis. In theoretical\r\nanalysis, a principled methodology is carried out to derive an\r\nanalytical bound of the (run-time) solution quality. After $n$\r\nevaluations/steps, the quality of the returned solution is evaluated by\r\na loss/regret measure.\r\n\r\n#### \r\n\r\nAlternatively, empirical analysis employs experimental simulations of\r\nthe algorithm on complex problems, gaining an insight on the algorithm’s\r\npracticality/applicability on real-world problems. With this regard,\r\nmost of the time, methods proposed to solve MOPs are benchmarked on a\r\ndifferent set of problems under arbitrary budgets of function\r\nevaluation. We are interested in empirically assess published/novel\r\nmulti-objective optimization algorithms in a unified (constantly\r\nupdated) framework.\r\n\r\n#### \r\n\r\nWe invite the multi-objective community to test their published/novel\r\nalgorithms in solving 100 <span\r\nstyle=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MOP</span>s reported in the literature\r\nwhere the feasible decision space has simple bound constraints, i.e.,\r\nproblems for which X=[l,u] and\r\nl<u. The benchmark validates the efficacy of the\r\nalgorithms by computing several quality indicators which are reported in\r\nterms of data profiles.\r\n\r\n### Test Problems\r\n\r\nThe table below lists the 100 MOPs with a brief description\r\nof their properties.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ash-aldujaili/BMOBench/gh-pages/images/problems-table.PNG)\r\n\r\n#### References\r\n\r\nThe BMOBench platform is inspired by two solid papers from the literature:\r\n\r\n1.
