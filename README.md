# BMOBench
Welcome to **B**lack-Box **M**ulti-Objective **O**ptimization **B**enchmarking (**BMOB**) Platform.

The aim of this platform is to consolidate black-box multi-objectives problems from the literature into a single framework; which makes it easier for researchers in the Multi-Objective Optimization community to compare, assess, and analyze previous and new algorithms comprehensively.

It is inspired by two solid papers from the literature:

1. Custódio, Ana Luísa, et al. "**[Direct multisearch for multiobjective optimization.](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~lnv/papers/dms.pdf)**" *SIAM Journal on Optimization* 21.3 (2011): 1109-1140.

2. Brockhoff, Dimo, Thanh-Do Tran, and Nikolaus Hansen. "**[Benchmarking numerical multiobjective optimizers revisited.](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01146741/document)**" *Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2015)*. 2015.
